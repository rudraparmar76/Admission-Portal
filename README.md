# Admission Portal in C

This is a simple Admission Portal in C programming language that allows students to apply for admission to a university or college. The portal collects student's personal information, academic records, and other relevant details required for admission. This program is built using C programming language, and it can be run on any platform with a C compiler.

## Features

- Allows students to register for admission by providing their personal information such as name, date of birth, address, etc.
- Collects academic records, including the school attended, grade point average, and test scores.
- Supports multiple programs and courses, allowing students to choose the one that suits them.
- Validates user input to ensure that only valid data is entered.
- Stores student records in a file for future reference.

## How to Run

1. Install a C compiler on your computer. If you don't have one, you can download it from the internet.
2. Download the Admission Portal source code from this repository and save it to your local computer.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the source code.
4. Compile the code using the C compiler. For example, if you are using gcc compiler, type `gcc AdmissionPortal.c -o AdmissionPortal` and press enter.
5. Run the executable file using the command `./AdmissionPortal` on Linux or MacOS, or `AdmissionPortal.exe` on Windows.

## Usage

2. Select the option to register for admission, and enter your personal information and academic records.
3. Choose the program or course you wish to apply for.
4. Review your information and make any necessary changes before submitting your application.
5. Your application will be saved to a file for future reference.
6. To view the list of all registered students, select the option from the main menu.

## Video Tutorial
We have created a video tutorial that shows how to use the Admission Portal to register for admission. The tutorial demonstrates how to run the program, enter personal and academic information, and choose a program or course to apply for. You can watch the [VideoTutorial](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QoYCYQPyLXPTEfIrq_NeeqiCsQ2o_nqI/view?usp=sharing). We hope that this video will help you understand how to use the Admission Portal and register for admission smoothly.

## About Us
We are a group of students currently pursuing a Diploma in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at [SVKM's Shri Bhagubhai Mafatlal Polytechnic](https://sbmp.ac.in/). Despite being in our second semester of the program, we wanted to challenge ourselves and apply the basic knowledge we had acquired in C programming to build a useful and practical program.

With the help of our instructors and online resources, we were able to develop the Admission Portal program that you see in this repository. While we know that there is still room for improvement, we are proud of what we have achieved so far and are eager to continue learning and growing as developers.

We hope that this project will serve as a testament to what can be accomplished with hard work, determination, and a willingness to learn.
